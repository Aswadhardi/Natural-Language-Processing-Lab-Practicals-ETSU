    "## Reflection:\n",
    "*This practical lab activity was an experience that incresead my appreciate for the theorotical session and gained a deeper understanding of NLP concepts and techniques for text representaion. I practised key concepts like tokenization, one hot ncoding, ignoring of punctuations, stop word removal, and n-gram analysis while familiarizing with popular NLP libraries like NLTK.*\n",
    " However an interesting exeperience was the fact that I hadd 155 sonnets , i realized I included a preamble which was not a sonnet and then I was able to get 154. but the question said I should expect 144. I think in my opinion 154 sonnet might be correct as opposed to 144.\n",
    "## Importance:\n",
    "*These skills will be crucial for working with text data in the real world. Based on this activity I am prepared to use it in various NLP applications like text classification, information retrieval, machine translation, and chatbots. By developing these techniques, I can contribute to the development of intelligent systems if I develop these skills and techniques for real world problems.*\n"
