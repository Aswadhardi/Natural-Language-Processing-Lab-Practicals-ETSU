This backdrop \nhas caused our customers to seek our \nguidance to help them navigate an  \nuncertain landscape with increasingly \ninterconnected risks.  \n\nWe believe our commitment to supporting sustainable \nand inclusive economies and communities is more \nimportant now than ever. In fact, responsible decision-\nmaking is part of the fabric of our Company and \nsustainability goals are embedded as core objectives in \nour strategic roadmap. For a knowledge company like \nMoody\u2019s, sustainability is made possible by our people. \nTogether, we\u2019re adapting to meet the evolving needs \nof our customers, while also helping more companies \nassess a range of risks. Our sustainability commitment \nalso extends to our workplace, where we continue to \nfocus on making Moody\u2019s a place where people want  \nto come and stay. \n\nThere are several achievements from 2022 that we  \ncan be proud of: We were one of the first companies to \nhave our near- and long-term net-zero climate targets \nvalidated by the Science Based Targets initiative. \nThrough our role as a founding member of the Net Zero \nFinancial Services Provider Alliance and our membership \nof the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, \nwe also played a key role in helping shape industrywide \nsustainability initiatives and reporting standards.\n\nDespite these very important steps forward, we know \nthere is still work to be done. That\u2019s why we are focused \non further reducing energy consumption and greenhouse \ngas emissions across our operations and value chain. \nThis includes having nearly half of our current suppliers \nglobally implement science-based climate targets. We \nalso recently refreshed our materiality assessment so \nthat our sustainability strategy continues to be aligned \nwith our stakeholders\u2019 priorities. Additionally, we are \nbringing together our broad firmographic, weather, and \nESG datasets to help insurers and banks better identify, \nmeasure and manage sustainability, physical and \ntransition risks.  \n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re adapting to meet the evolving \nneeds of our customers, while also helping more \ncompanies assess a range of risks.\u201d\n\nImportantly, we are deeply invested in fostering a \nsupportive and diverse workforce, while also advancing \nmore equitable economies and communities. This \nyear, we rolled out several new employee training and \ndevelopment programs, which focus on topics such \nas sustainability and leadership, to help empower \nour employees pursue their career paths. We also \nimplemented an enhanced approach to our community \nengagement work that draws on our people, solutions \nand capital to support communities around the world. \nWe were honored to be a founding member of the U.S. \nEconomic Opportunity Coalition (EOC), which  \n\nis focused on aligning public and private investments to \naccelerate inclusive, sustainable economic growth. The \nEOC\u2019s strategic objective aligns well with our Creating \nOpportunities for Racial Equity (CORE) program, which \nleverages our expertise and capabilities to support \nthe growth of Community Development Financial \nInstitutions and Minority Depository Institutions  \nwhich play a vital role in our economy.\n\nMoody\u2019s achievements are the result of the hard work, \ncollaboration and innovation of my colleagues across \nthe company. While we know there\u2019s more work to do  \n\nto realize a sustainable future \u2013 we have confidence in \nwhat we as a company are able to accomplish because \nwe do it together.\n\nThank you to our customers and stakeholders for \nthe trust you place in Moody\u2019s. We look forward to \nadvancing more of this important work in 2023 as we \ncontinue delivering integrated perspectives on risk.\n\nROB FAUBER \nPresident and CEO, Moody\u2019s Corporation \n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK##2022 Sustainability Highlights\n\n \n\n2022 Sustainability Highlights \n\n| \n\n4\n\nA MESSAGE  \nFROM OUR  \nPRESIDENT  \n& CEO\n\n2022  \nSUSTAINABILITY \nHIGHLIGHTS \n\nABOUT  \nMOODY\u2019S\n\nBETTER  \nBUSINESS\n\nBETTER  \nLIVES\n\nBETTER  \nSOLUTIONS\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nBetter Business\nWe accelerated our work to embed \nprincipled, sustainable decision-making \ninto our operations and value chain by:\n\n \u00bb Becoming one of the first companies  \n\nto have our near- and long-term  \nnet-zero climate targets validated by \nthe Science Based Targets initiative.\n\n49%\n\nof suppliers by spend \nhave science-based \ntargets\n\n \u00bb Increasing the share of our suppliers by spend who have science-based \n\ntargets to 49%, exceeding our internal annual target.\n\n \u00bb Making sustainability one of the core Strategic and Operational \n\ncompensation metrics for all applicable employees.\n\n \u00bb Launching our cybersecurity online learning program, CybSafe, to educate \n\nour employees on leading cyber hygiene practices.\n\n \u00bb Publishing our Global Tax Policy that aligns our tax practices with our \n\nsustainability framework.\n\n1 Employee-led giving includes grants paid from Moody\u2019s Foundation toward the Matching Gifts and Dollars for \nDoers programs.\n2 Approximate ESG & Climate revenue from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Moody\u2019s Analytics as of \nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nBetter Lives\nWe fostered a nurturing and inclusive \nculture in our workplace and supported  \nour communities by: \n\n \u00bb Progressing on our customer-focused \n\n$11.5\n\nMILLION\nin treasury deposits \ninto Black-owned banks\n\ndiversity, equity and inclusion \ninitiative, Creating Opportunities for \nRacial Equity (CORE), by joining the \nEconomic Opportunity Coalition, and depositing $1.5 million of treasury \ndeposits into Black-owned banks in addition to $10 million in 2021.\n\n \u00bb Evolving our global employee well-being approach to place a greater \n\nemphasis on holistic wellness.\n\nBetter Solutions\nWe continue to provide trusted  \nperspectives that inform a clear and  \nholistic understanding of risk by:\n\n$190\n\nMILLION\nin ESG and  \nClimate revenue\n\n \u00bb Embedding environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) and climate \nconsiderations into our analytics, \nworkflow solutions and research, and \nincreasing transparency on how ESG factors affect credit ratings.\n\n \u00bb Launching our new ESG Insurance Underwriting Solution, which integrates \n\nindicators and scores to help commercial property and casualty insurers \noperationalize ESG risk assessment.\n\n \u00bb Expanding our learning and development offerings by launching  \n\n \u00bb Expanding our Issuer Profile Scores (IPS) and Credit Impact Scores (CIS) \n\nMoody\u2019s University, offering over 50,000 accessible learning materials  \nfor our employees.\n\nto cover more than 10,000 governments, financial institutions and \ncorporations across sectors globally.\n\n \u00bb Engaging our communities through our employees\u2019 contribution of over \n14,000 volunteer hours and more than $7 million in Moody\u2019s Foundation \ngrants, corporate charitable contributions, value of volunteer hours and \nemployee-led giving.1\n\n \u00bb Joining the Climate Data Steering Committee to help make climate \n\ntransition-related data freely available in a single place for the first time.\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK## \n\nAbout Moody\u2019s \n\n| \n\n5\n\nAbout Moody\u2019s \n\nMoody\u2019s at a Glance\nAbout This Report\nOur Commitment to Sustainability \n\nBetter Lives \f##PAGE_BREAK## \n\nMoody\u2019s at a Glance \n\n| \n\n6\n\nA MESSAGE  \nFROM OUR  \nPRESIDENT  \n& CEO\n\n2022  \nSUSTAINABILITY \nHIGHLIGHTS \n\nABOUT  \nMOODY\u2019S\nMoody\u2019s at a Glance\n\nAbout This Report\n\nOur Commitment to \nSustainability\n\nBETTER  \nBUSINESS\n\nBETTER  \nLIVES\n\nBETTER  \nSOLUTIONS\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nMoody\u2019s at a Glance\n\nWHO WE ARE\nMoody\u2019s (NYSE: MCO) is a global integrated risk \nassessment firm that empowers organizations to identify, \nmanage and measure risk and unlock opportunity. \n\nWHAT WE DO\nOur products and solutions help our customers to better \nunderstand the risk of doing business with others.

The Code of Business Conduct is revised and \nrepublished at least every two years and is available in  \n11 languages. In addition, Moody\u2019s Investors Service \n(MIS) has a Code of Professional Conduct that governs \nits credit ratings activities. \n\nAll employees, including full-time and part-time \nemployees, must complete compliance and ethics \ntraining as an integral part of their professional \ndevelopment.

Additionally, \nwe offer guidance through our internal Anti-Bribery \nResource Center. The anti-bribery and anti-corruption \nprogram is periodically reviewed by our Internal Audit \ndepartment. For more information, see Moody\u2019s  \nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\nAny corruption incidents required to be reported in \nMoody\u2019s SEC filings would be reflected in such filings. \nNo such incidents were reported in SEC filings in the \nreporting period.\n\nWe comply with all applicable anti-money laundering \n(AML) laws and related Know Your Customer (KYC) and \nEnhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requirements wherever \nwe operate. Although our business activities generally \ndo not expose us to the risk of being a conduit for money \nlaundering activity, in certain jurisdictions our role in \nthe financial transactions of others may subject our \nactivity to locally applicable AML laws or regulations \nand require the establishment of an AML program.

The BES helps us to: \n\n \u00bb Understand our employees\u2019 level of engagement at \nperiodic intervals throughout the year (for example, \nthrough shorter, more frequent pulse surveys). \n\n \u00bb Inform our actions through the use of a validated \n\nmeasure of engagement. \n\n \u00bb Reinforce managers\u2019 roles to take action by dedicating \n\nspecific resources to address opportunity areas \nidentified by the survey results. \n\n \u00bb Assess employee sentiment around longevity and \n\nintent to stay, which helps us to frame actions that \ndrive talent retention.\n\nWe continued to refine our approach, reducing the \nnumber of survey questions and focusing on six \nkey drivers of engagement: Purpose, leadership, \nmanager effectiveness, well-being, connection and \nempowerment. Our 2022 employee engagement \nscore was 75 \u2014 measured by employees reporting how \nhappy they are at Moody\u2019s and whether they would \nrecommend working here. \n\nWe use the feedback we received through the BES \nas a vital input into making decisions to improve our \nemployee experience. Notable examples of how we  \nare responding to employee feedback include:\n\n \u00bb Our employees reported that work flexibility was an \n\nimportant driver of engagement and productivity, \nwhile also noting that they are looking for more ways \nto connect socially with one another. PurposeFirst, \nour new framework for deciding where and how \nto collaborate, will provide opportunities to build \nstronger connections (see Defining our new way of \nworking with PurposeFirst). \n\n \u00bb While most employees intend to stay at Moody\u2019s, \nthey are also interested in more career pathing and \ndevelopment opportunities, which we are providing \nthrough our expanded suite of learning offerings (see \nLearning and Development). We also plan to launch a \npilot career development platform, which will provide \nemployees access and agency to develop their careers \nusing an internal marketplace of continuous growth \nopportunities. In addition, we are currently evaluating \nour recognition framework in order to build better \nhabits in our peer-to-peer and leader-to-employee \nrecognition approach.\n\n \u00bb Employees value their managers and would \nrecommend them to others.

In light of this dynamic, we piloted \nseveral initiatives to help engage and retain talent, and \nto position us to better understand our workforce.\n\nFor example, we initiated the Stay Conversations \ninitiative, designed to provide recognition for high-\nimpact talent and explore what employees find \nmeaningful and engaging as part of their professional \njourney. These conversations focus on identifying \ndevelopment opportunities, with the goal of keeping \nemployees engaged in their role at Moody\u2019s. Following \nthe conversations, managers are asked to document and \ncomplete specific development actions to help translate \ninsights gleaned through the conversations into tangible \nprogress against the professional goals our employees \narticulate. Stay Conversations are a critical path to \nbetter understand our talent, their employee experience, \ncareer paths and feedback, ultimately resulting in \nincreased high-impact talent retention.\n\nWe also tested a framework for identifying high-\npotential employees and critical roles across the \norganization. We anticipate that standardizing this \nframework will help leaders across our organization \nmore effectively and objectively assess talent, identify \nfuture leaders and communicate with one another about \ndevelopment and growth opportunities for employees. \nWe identified and track over 70 strategic roles across \nMoody\u2019s, striving to have no more than 10% of these \nroles vacant at any given time, an internal target that  \nwe achieved as of December 31.\n\nIn 2023, we plan to deploy a standard approach to  \nglobal talent reviews, providing consistency to the  \nentire organization in how we identify, engage and  \nretain future leaders.\n\nNew employee hires1\n\n3,541\n\n2,707\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n39%\n\n2022 new hires \n\nby gender\n\n61%\n\n  Male         \n\n  Female\n\nTalent attraction\n\nNumber of unfilled \npositions (rounded)2,3\n\nOpen positions filled  \nby candidates in  \ncalendar year3,4\n\nAverage hiring cost/ \nFTE (USD, rounded)5\n\n2021\n\n320\n\n2022\n\n230\n\n20%\n\n16%\n\n$6,000\n\n$5,100\n\n1 Excludes hires through acquisition. \n2 Positions that had been open for 90 days or longer as of December 31st of \nrespective year.\n3 2021 data excludes certain nonwholly owned subsidiaries and newly \nacquired companies not integrated in Moody\u2019s IT systems.\n\n4 2021 metrics were restated due to a change in methodology.\n5 2021 metrics were restated due to a change in methodology and to include  \nnonwholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nEmployee turnover rate\nThe year-over-year increase in the voluntary turnover \nrate is likely due the overall strength of the job market \nglobally, especially for technology-related jobs.

Notable engagements throughout  \n2022 included:\n\n \u00bb Participating in a wide range of discussions during \n\nCOP27 in Egypt, including the World Climate Summit \nand the Finance Day of the Presidency, during which \nwe shared our insights and expertise on the challenges \nfaced by companies and investors as they seek to \nadopt and accelerate net-zero targets.\n\n \u00bb Facilitating Financing Resilience Alongside Net-Zero, \n\na half-day discussion during Climate Week NYC, to \nexplore how climate change is reshaping risk and \nopportunity across industry, finance and civil society.\n\n \u00bb Convening our flagship global ESG conferences  \n\nin EMEA and APAC, bringing together experts  \non biodiversity, sustainable finance and  \nclimate-related risk.\n\n \u00bb Submitting 21 total consultations to standard setters, \n\nregulators and ESG influencers in Europe, North \nAmerica and APAC.\n\n \u00bb Publishing 97 thought leadership papers, hosted  \n\non the ESG Insights and Analysis hub.\n\nRepresentative selection of our partners\n\nEngaging through partnerships\nIndustry partnerships are a critical pillar of our \nengagement activities. Through our affiliation with \nleading market organizations, we foster opportunities \nto gain first-hand, valuable insights from market \nparticipants and contribute to joint thought leadership. \n\nFor example, as part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance \nfor Net Zero (GFANZ), we are a founding member of \nthe Net Zero Financial Services Provider Alliance, a \nglobal group of 27 financial service providers committed \nto supporting the goal of global net-zero greenhouse \nemissions by 2050 or sooner. We are committed to \naligning our relevant products and services to this goal, \nin addition to reducing our own operational emissions. \nAs part of the GFANZ workstream, we contribute to \nrecommendations and guidance for financial institutions\u2019 \ntransition planning and the implementation of net-zero \ncommitments. We were featured in a case study for \nthe GFANZ draft report Measuring Portfolio Alignment, \nwhich provides guidance on measuring how investment, \nlending and underwriting activities align with the goals \nof the Paris Agreement and critical 2050 global net-\nzero objectives. We were also featured in the GFANZ \nreport Recommendations and Guidance on Financial \nInstitutions Net-zero Transition Plans, which provides \nfinancial institutions with potential strategies for \nmeeting net-zero commitments.\n\n \n\nESG Research and Partnerships \n\n|  68\n\nSocial implications of a just transition\nThe transition toward net-zero emissions will reshape economies globally, and distribute costs and benefits \nunevenly. A \u201cjust transition\u201d seeks to maximize the socioeconomic benefits of decarbonization while minimizing \nthe negative impact. In a recent research report, we examined whether emerging market entities are prepared to \nmanage the social implications of global decarbonization.\n\nOur conclusions included:\n\n \u00bb The carbon transition will likely be more difficult for \n\nemerging market sovereigns, which typically have more \nexposure to social risks, weaker governance and lower \nfinancial buffers than advanced economies.\n\n \u00bb Growth and innovation in emerging market sovereign  \nbond issuance can help fill the substantial funding gap \nbetween sovereigns\u2019 current budgets and projected just \ntransition costs.\n\n \u00bb The net-zero transition will involve a \n\nsignificant allocation of corporate \nresources. Companies in emerging \nmarkets are generally not well \nprepared to manage reorganization and \nprofessional development for workforces, or social and \neconomic development for local communities.\n\n\f##PAGE_BREAK## \n\nAppendix \n\n|  69\n\nAppendix\n\nMetric Summary\nFramework Index\nGlossary\nAdditional Resources\n\nBetter Lives \f##PAGE_BREAK##Metric Summary\n\nThe following metric summary contains the data and metrics referenced in our 2022 Stakeholder Sustainability Report.

represents approximately 90% of employees (excludes certain nonwholly owned subsidiaries and newly acquired companies which are not integrated in Moody\u2019s IT systems and therefore the survey was not distributed to them).\n3 Employee engagement score is an average of two items: \u201cHow happy are you at Moody\u2019s?\u201d and \u201cWould you recommend Moody\u2019s?\u201d\n4 The global benchmark provided by the survey third-party service provider is based on cross-client, cross-industry and cross-country company data from well over 700 organizations and over 150 countries.\n5 The favorability score is the average percentage of employees that agree Moody\u2019s takes a genuine interest in their well-being.\n6 Limited duration employees, employees in a probation period or who joined Moody\u2019s from newly acquired companies do not participate in the GPS performance review process. Certain nonwholly owned subsidiaries for which this data was not yet available are excluded from the analysis.
