# 2. Getting started 
For effective appreciaiton of the contents and labs.
    At least a sufficient understanding of intermediate python is required.
        Setting up of a environement with NLTK, Spacy, CoreNLP, Gensim and other import libraries.

## Project Reference
My project to illustrate my NLP and text analysis learning experience with a project on an automatic ESG reports analysis tool based using Topic Modeling and ESBERT Model a specialized language model for ESG text classification to classify sentences into the respective ESG pilars.
